-- Slicing and Dicing --

* Slice your list, which means selecting multiple elements from your list.
    ie.
        my_list[start:end]
*The code sample below shows an example. A list with "b" and "c", corresponding to indexes 1 and 2,
 are selected from a list x:
    ie.
        x = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
        x[1:3]

* If you don't specify the begin index, Python figures out that you want to start your slice
    at the beginning of your list.
*  If you don't specify the end index, the slice will go all the way to the last element of your list.
    ie.
        x = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
        x[:2]
        x[2:]
        x[:]

-- Subsetting lists of lists --
* To subset lists of lists, you can use the same technique as before: square brackets.
    ie.
        x = [["a", "b", "c"],
         ["d", "e", "f"],
         ["g", "h", "i"]]
        x[2][0]
        x[2][:2]
